# Extending-a-32-bit-CPU-Instruction-Set
A University of the Philippines Diliman Projects that focuses on learning system verilog

For this project, we were asked to modify the processor to create 5 new instructions:
1. Shift left logical (sll)
2. Store byte (sb)
3. Branch on less than or equal (ble)
4. Load immediate (li)
5. Zero-from-right (zfr)

EDA playground was used to do this project.

Please see the documentation file for more information and how I solved it.

Kindly [email](cbragunton@up.edu.ph) me if you want to see the project specifications.
